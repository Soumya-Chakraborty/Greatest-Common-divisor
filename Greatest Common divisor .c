#include <stdio.h> // This is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the standard input/output header file stdio.h in the program. This file contains functions and macros for input/output operations, such as printf ().

int gcd (int a, int b) // This is a function definition that takes two integer parameters a and b and returns an integer value. The function name gcd stands for greatest common divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder.

{ // This is an opening curly bracket that marks the beginning of the function body or block of code.

// base case : This is a comment that explains the purpose of the following code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to make the code more readable and understandable.

if (b == 0) // This is an if statement that checks if the condition inside the parentheses is true or false. In this case, it checks if b is equal to 0 using the equality operator ==.

{ // This is another opening curly bracket that marks the beginning of the block of code that will execute if the condition is true.

return a; // This is a return statement that exits the function and returns the value of a to the caller. The return type of the function must match the type of the value returned.

} // This is a closing curly bracket that marks the end of the block of code that will execute if the condition is true.

// recursive case : This is another comment that explains the purpose of the following code.

else // This is an else statement that executes the block of code following it if the condition of the preceding if statement is false.

{ // This is another opening curly bracket that marks the beginning of the block of code that will execute if the condition is false.

return gcd (b, a % b); // This is another return statement that returns the value of calling the gcd function recursively with b and a % b as arguments. The % operator is the modulo operator that gives the remainder of dividing a by b.

} // This is another closing curly bracket that marks the end of the block of code that will execute if the condition is false.

} // This is another closing curly bracket that marks the end of the function body or block of code.

int main () //This is another function definition that takes no parameters and returns an integer value. The main function is special because it is where the program execution starts. Every C program must have one and only one main function.

{ // This is another opening curly bracket that marks the beginning of the main function body or block of code.

int j = 1980; // This is a variable declaration and initialization that creates an integer variable named j and assigns it the value 1980 using the assignment operator =.

int k = 1617; // This is another variable declaration and initialization that creates an integer variable named k and assigns it the value 1617.

printf ("GCD of %d and %d is %d\n", j, k, gcd (j, k)); // This is a function call that invokes the printf function from stdio.h with a string literal and three integer values as arguments. The printf function prints formatted output to the standard output device (usually the screen). The string literal contains format specifiers that indicate how to print each argument. For example, %d means print an integer in decimal notation. The \n means print a newline character to move to the next line.

return 0; // This is another return statement that exits the main function and returns 0 to indicate successful termination of the program.

} // This is another closing curly bracket that marks the end of the main function body or block of code.
